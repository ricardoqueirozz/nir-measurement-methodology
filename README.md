# Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Field (RF-EMF) Measurements in Buildings.

This repository contains the data and scripts used in the master's thesis titled **"TBD"**. The thesis covers the methods and results of NIR measurements conducted in buildings with Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) in it rooftop or buildings which some floors are under BTSs line of sight.

## Authors

The thesis was conducted by [**Ricardo Queiroz de Farias Henrique Silva**](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0861-4341), under the supervision of [**Dr. Vicente Angelo de Sousa Junior**](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2859-6136), as part of the requirements for the Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte.

## Repository Structure

The repository has two folders, containing the files described below.

### Datasets
- [Brazilian National Telecommunication Agency (ANATEL) BTSs informations](https://github.com/ricardoqueirozz/nir-measurement-methodology/blob/main/datasets/);
- Measurements conducted in the buildings - TBD.
 
### Scripts

The scripts are divided by purpose, methodology and results. They were made in ipynbs, which also contains usage explanations.

#### Methodology
- [Plots for azimuth analisys](https://github.com/ricardoqueirozz/nir-measurement-methodology/blob/main/scripts/azimuth_analysis.ipynb);
- [Plots for target floor analisys](https://github.com/ricardoqueirozz/nir-measurement-methodology/blob/main/scripts/floor_analysis.ipynb).

#### Results
- Results plots - TBD.
