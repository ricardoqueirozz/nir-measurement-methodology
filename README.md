# Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Field (RF-EMF) Measurements in Buildings.

This repository contains the data and scripts used in the master's thesis titled "A Novel Approach for Assessments of Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields Exposure in Buildings Near Telecommunication Infrastructure" and the works derived from it.

## Authors

The thesis was conducted by [**Ricardo Queiroz de Farias Henrique Silva**](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0861-4341), under the supervision of [**Dr. Vicente Angelo de Sousa Junior**](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2859-6136), as part of the requirements for the Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte.

## Repository Structure
